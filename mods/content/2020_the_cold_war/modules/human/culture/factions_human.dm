While retaining the socialist roots of its predecessor, this nation embarked on a path of gradual change, embracing elements of cultural Westernization and liberalization of the economy. \
	Unlike the rigid central planning of the past, the Union now allows for some local enterprises to thrive, particularly in agriculture, fostering innovation and diversity in production. \
	Perhaps the most significant shift is towards a semi-democratic system, where citizens have the right to vote for parliamentarians representing the Soviet Party."
