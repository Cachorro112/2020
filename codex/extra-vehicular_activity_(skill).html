<h3>OOC Information</h3>
<p><div class='codexMechanics'><h4>Unskilled</h4>You have basic safety training common to people who work in space: You know how to put on and seal your internals, and you can probably struggle into a space suit if you really need to, though you'll be clumsy at it. You're still prone to mistakes that may leave you trying to breathe vacuum.<br>- You can remove hardsuits. Its speed increases with level.<br>- You will always get floored when you enter gravity area from space. This chance decreases with level.<br>- You are likely to slip. This chance decreases with level.<br><h4>Basic</h4>You have had thorough basic training in EVA operations, and are unlikely to make novice mistakes. However, you have little experience working in vacuum.<br><h4>Trained</h4>You can comfortably use a space suit and do so regularly in the course of your work. Checking your internals is second nature to you, and you don't panic in an emergency.<br>- You can fully operate jetpacks.<br><h4>Experienced</h4>You can use all kinds of space suits, including specialized versions. Your years of experience in EVA keep you from being disoriented in space, and you have experience using a jetpack to move around. <br>- You cannot slip anymore.<br><h4>Master</h4>You are just as much at home in a vacuum as in atmosphere. You probably do your job almost entirely EVA.<br>- You cannot get floored anymore.<br>- You get bonus speed in zero-G.</div></p>
