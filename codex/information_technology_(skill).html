<h1>Information Technology (skill)</h1>
<div class='dmCodexBody'>
<p><div class='codexLore'>Describes your understanding of computers, software and communication. Not a requirement for using computers, but definitely helps. Used in telecommunications and programming of computers and AIs.</div></p>
<h3>OOC Information</h3>
<p><div class='codexMechanics'><h4>Unskilled</h4>You know how to use the computers and communication devices that you grew up with. You can use a computer console, a handheld or wall-mounted radio, and your headset, as well as your PDA. You know what an AI is, but you may see them as either "people made of silicon" or "only machines"; you know they have to obey their laws, but you don't know much about how or why they work.<br><h4>Basic</h4>You know the basics of programming, but you're not very good at it and couldn't do it professionally. You have a pretty good idea of what makes AIs tick. You understand how information is stored in a computer, and you can fix simple computer problems. You're computer-literate, but you still make mistakes. If you tried to subvert the AI, you might make mistakes in wording your new laws.<br>- The antagonist access decryption program has a chance to avoid tripping alarms and working more effectively. This increases with level.<br><h4>Trained</h4>At this level, you're probably working with computers on a daily basis. You understand and can repair the telecommunications network. Your understanding of AI programming and psychology lets you fix problems with the AIs or cyborgs--or create problems, if you so desire. You can program computers and AIs and change their laws effectively.<br>- You can fully operate the Network Monitor, E-mail Administration, and AI Management Programs.<br><h4>Experienced</h4>You have years of experience with computer networks, AI systems, telecommunications, and sysadmin tasks. You know the systems used on a daily basis intimately, and can diagnose complex problems.<br>- The antagonist dos program gives extra fake attacking nodes to the system log.<br>- You can use the command line on modular computers (type "man" for a list).<br><h4>Master</h4>People are probably starting to wonder whether you might be a computer yourself. Computer code is your first language; you relate to AIs as easily as (probably more easily than) organics. You could build a telecommunications network from the ground up.</div></p>
