<h1>Anatomy (skill)</h1>
<div class='dmCodexBody'>
<p><div class='codexLore'>Gives you a detailed insight of the human body. A high skill in this is required to perform surgery. This skill may also help in examining alien biology.</div></p>
<h3>OOC Information</h3>
<p><div class='codexMechanics'><h4>Unskilled</h4>You know what organs, bones, and such are, and you know roughly where they are. You know that someone who's badly hurt or sick may need surgery.<br><h4>Basic</h4>You've taken an anatomy class and you've spent at least some time poking around inside actual people. You know where everything is, more or less. You could assist in surgery, if you have the required medical skills. If you have the forensics knowledge, you could perform an autopsy. If you really had to, you could probably perform basic surgery such as an appendectomy, but you're not yet a qualified surgeon and you really shouldn't--not unless it's an emergency. If you're a xenobiologist, you know how to take out slime cores.<br><h4>Trained</h4>You have some training in anatomy. Diagnosing broken bones, damaged ligaments, shrapnel wounds, and other trauma is straightforward for you. You can splint limbs with a good chance of success, operate a defibrillator competently, and perform CPR well. Surgery is still outside your training.<br>- You can do surgery (requires Trained Medicine skill too) but you are very likely to fail at every step. Its speed increases with level. You can perform the cybernethics procedures if you have Trained Complex Devices skill<br><h4>Experienced</h4>You're a surgical resident, or an experienced medical doctor. You can put together broken bones, fix a damaged lung, patch up a liver, or remove an appendix without problems. But tricky surgeries, with an unstable patient or delicate manipulation of vital organs like the heart and brain, are at the edge of your ability, and you prefer to leave them to specialized surgeons. You can recognize when someone's anatomy is noticeably unusual. You're trained in working with several species, but you're probably better at surgery on your own species.<br>- You can do all surgery steps safely, if you have Experienced Medicine skill too.<br><h4>Master</h4>You are an experienced surgeon. You can handle anything that gets rolled, pushed, or dragged into the OR, and you can keep a patient alive and stable even if there's no one to assist you. You can handle severe trauma cases or multiple organ failure, repair brain damage, and perform heart surgery. By now, you've probably specialized in one field, where you may have made new contributions to surgical technique. You can detect even small variations in the anatomy of a patient--very little will slip by your notice, provided you could get them on the operating table.<br>- The penalty from operating on improper operating surfaces is reduced.</div></p>
