<h1>Engines (skill)</h1>
<div class='dmCodexBody'>
<p><div class='codexLore'>Describes your knowledge of the various engine types common on space stations, such as the PACMAN, singularity, supermatter or RUST engine.</div></p>
<h3>OOC Information</h3>
<p><div class='codexMechanics'><h4>Unskilled</h4>You know that "delamination" is a bad thing and that you should stay away from the singularity. You know the engine provides power, but you're unclear on the specifics. If you were to try to set up the engine, you would need someone to talk you through every detail--and even then, you'd probably make deadly mistakes.<br>- You can read the SM monitor readings with 40% error. This decreases with level.<br><h4>Basic</h4>You know the basic theoretical principles of engine operation. You can try to set up the engine by yourself, but you are likely to need some assistance and supervision, otherwise you are likely to make mistakes. You are fully capable of running a PACMAN-type generator.<br><h4>Trained</h4>You can set up the engine, and you probably won't botch it up too badly. You know how to protect yourself from radiation in the engine room. You can read the engine monitors and keep the engine going. An engine malfunction may stump you, but you can probably work out how to fix it... let's just hope you do so quickly enough to prevent serious damage.<br><h4>Experienced</h4>You have years of experience with engines, and can set them up quickly and reliably. You're familiar with engine types other than the one you work with.<br>- You can fully read the SM monitor readings.<br>- You can examine the SM directly for its integrity.<br><h4>Master</h4>Your engine is your baby and you know every minute detail of its workings. You can optimize the engine and you probably have your own favorite custom setup. You could build an engine from the ground up. When things go wrong, you know exactly what has happened and how to fix the problem. You can safely handle singularities and supermatter.<br>- You can examine the SM directly for an approximate number of its EER.</div></p>
