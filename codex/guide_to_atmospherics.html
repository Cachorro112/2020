		<h1><a name="Foreword"><U><B>HOW TO NOT SUCK QUITE SO HARD AT ATMOSPHERICS</B></U></a></h1>
		<I>Or: What the fuck does a "pressure regulator" do?</I><BR>
		Alright. It has come to my attention that a variety of people are unsure of what a "pipe" is and what it does.
		Apparently, there is an unnatural fear of these arcane devices and their "gases." Spooky, spooky. So,
		this will tell you what every device constructable by an ordinary pipe dispenser within atmospherics actually does.
		You are not going to learn what to do with them to be the super best person ever, or how to play guitar with passive gates,
		or something like that. Just what stuff does.<BR>
		<h1><a name="Basic"><B>Basic Pipes</B></a></h1>
		<I>The boring ones.</I>
		Most ordinary pipes are pretty straightforward. They hold gas. If gas is moving in a direction for some reason, gas will flow in that direction.
		That's about it. Even so, here's all of your wonderful pipe options.
		<ul>
		<li><b>Straight pipes:</b> They're pipes. One-meter sections. Straight line. Pretty simple. Just about every pipe and device is based around this
		standard one-meter size, so most things will take up as much space as one of these.</li>
		<li><b>Bent pipes:</b> Pipes with a 90 degree bend at the half-meter mark. My goodness.</li>
		<li><b>Pipe manifolds:</b> Pipes that are essentially a "T" shape, allowing you to connect three things at one point.</li>
		<li><b>4-way manifold:</b> A four-way junction.</li>
		<li><b>Pipe cap:</b> Caps off the end of a pipe. Open ends don't actually vent air, because of the way the pipes are assembled, so, uh, use them to decorate your house or something.</li>
		<li><b>Manual valve:</b> A valve that will block off airflow when turned. Can't be used by the AI or cyborgs, because they don't have hands.</li>
		<li><b>Manual T-valve:</b> Like a manual valve, but at the center of a manifold instead of a straight pipe.</li><BR>
		</ul>
		An important note here is that pipes are now done in three distinct lines - general, supply, and scrubber. You can move gases between these with a universal adapter. Use the correct position for the correct location.
		Connecting scrubbers to a supply position pipe makes you an idiot who gives everyone a difficult job. Insulated and HE pipes don't go through these positions.
		<h1><a name="Insulated"><B>Insulated Pipes</B></a></h1>
		<li><I>Bent pipes:</I> Pipes with a 90 degree bend at the half-meter mark. My goodness.</li>

		<h1><a name="Insulated"><B>Insulated Pipes</B></a></h1>
		<I>Special Public Service Announcement.</I>
		Our regular pipes are already insulated. These are completely worthless. Punch anyone who uses them.<BR>
		<h1><a name="Devices"><B>Devices: </B></a></h1>
		<I>They actually do something.</I>
		This is usually where people get frightened, afraid, and start calling on their gods and/or cowering in fear. Yes, I can see you doing that right now.
		Stop it. It's unbecoming. Most of these are fairly straightforward.
		<ul>
		<li><b>Gas pump:</b> Take a wild guess. It moves gas in the direction it's pointing (marked by the red line on one end). It moves it based on pressure, the maximum output being 15000 kPa (kilopascals).
		Ordinary atmospheric pressure, for comparison, is 101.3 kPa, and the minimum pressure of room-temperature pure oxygen needed to not suffocate in a matter of minutes is 16 kPa
		(though 18 kPa is preferred when using internals with pure oxygen, for various reasons). A high-powered variant will move gas more quickly at the expense of consuming more power. Do not turn the distribution loop up to 15000 kPa.
		You will make engiborgs cry and the Chief Engineer will beat you.</li>
		<li><b>Pressure regulator:</b> These replaced the old passive gates. You can choose to regulate pressure by input or output, and regulate flow rate. Regulating by input means that when input pressure is above the limit, gas will flow.
		Regulating by output means that when pressure is below the limit, gas will flow. Flow rate can be controlled.</li>
		<li><b>Unary vent:</b> The basic vent used in rooms. It pumps gas into the room, but can't suck it back out. Controlled by the room's air alarm system.</li>
		<li><b>Scrubber:</b> The other half of room equipment. Filters air, and can suck it in entirely in what's called a "panic siphon." Activating a panic siphon without very good reason will kill someone. Don't do it.</li>
		<li><b>Meter:</b> A little box with some gauges and numbers. Fasten it to any pipe or manifold and it'll read you the pressure in it. Very useful.</li>
		<li><b>Gas mixer:</b> Two sides are input, one side is output. Mixes the gases pumped into it at the ratio defined. The side perpendicular to the other two is "node 2," for reference, on non-mirrored mixers.
		Output is controlled by flow rate. There is also an "omni" variant that allows you to set input and output sections freely.</li>
		<li><b>Gas filter:</b> Essentially the opposite of a gas mixer. One side is input. The other two sides are output. One gas type will be filtered into the perpendicular output pipe,
		the rest will continue out the other side. Can also output from 0-4500 kPa. The "omni" vairant allows you to set input and output sections freely.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1><a name="HES"><B>Heat Exchange Systems</B></a></h1>
		<I>Will not set you on fire.</I>
		These systems are used to only transfer heat between two pipes. They will not move gases or any other element, but will equalize the temperature (eventually). Note that because of how gases work (remember: pv=nRt),
		a higher temperature will raise pressure, and a lower one will lower temperature.
		<li><I>Pipe:</I> This is a pipe that will exchange heat with the surrounding atmosphere. Place in fire for superheating. Place in space for supercooling.</li>
		<li><I>Bent pipe:</I> Take a wild guess.</li>
		<li><I>Junction:</I> The point where you connect your normal pipes to heat exchange pipes. Not necessary for heat exchangers, but necessary for H/E pipes/bent pipes.</li>
		<li><I>Heat exchanger:</I> These funky-looking bits attach to an open pipe end. Put another heat exchanger directly across from it, and you can transfer heat across two pipes without having to have the gases touch.
		This normally shouldn't exchange with the ambient air, despite being totally exposed. Just don't ask questions.</li>
		That's about it for pipes. Go forth, armed with this knowledge, and try not to break, burn down, or kill anything. Please.
