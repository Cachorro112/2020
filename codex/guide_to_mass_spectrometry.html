		<ul>
			<li><b>Mass spectrometry</b> - MS is the procedure used used to measure and quantify the components of matter. The most prized tool in the field of
				'Materials analysis.'</li>
			<li><b>Radiometric dating</b> - MS applied using the right carrier reagents can be used to accurately determine the age of a sample.</li>
			<li><b>Dissonance ratio</b> - This is a pseudoarbitrary value indicating the overall presence of a particular element in a greater composite.
				It takes into account volume, density, molecular excitation and isotope spread.</li>
			<li><b>Vacuum seal integrity</b> - A reference to how close an airtight seal is to failure.</li>

		<h1><a name="Analysis">Analysis progression</a></h1>
		Modern mass spectrometry requires constant attention from the diligent researcher in order to be successful. There are many different elements to juggle,
			and later chapters will delve into them. For the spectrometry assistant, the first thing you need to know is that the scanner wavelength is automatically
			calculated for you. Just tweak the settings and try to match it with the actual wavelength as closely as possible.

		<h1><a name="Seal">Seal integrity</a></h1>
		In order to maintain sterile and environmentally static procedures, a special chamber is set up inside the spectrometer. It's protected by a proprietary vacuum seal
			produced by top tier industrial science. It will only last for a certain number of scans before failing outright, but it can be resealed through use of nanite paste.
			Unfortunately, it's susceptible to malforming under heat stress so exposing it to higher temperatures will cause it's operation life to drop significantly.

		<h1><a name="Heat">Heat management</a></h1>
		The scanner relies on a gyro-rotational system that varies in speed and intensity. Over the course of an ordinary scan, the RPMs can change dramatically. Higher RPMs
			means greater heat generation, but is necessary for the ongoing continuation of the scan. To offset heat production, spectrometers have an inbuilt cooling system.
			Researchers can modify the flow rate of water to aid in dropping temperature as necessary, but are advised that frequent water replacements may be necessary
			depending on coolant purity. Other substances may be viable substitutes, but nowhere near as effective as water itself.

		<h1><a name="Radiation">Ambient radiation</a></h1>
		Researchers are warned that while operational, mass spectrometers emit period bursts of radiation and are thus advised to wear protective gear. In the event of
			radiation spikes, there is also a special shield that can be lowered to block emissions. Lowering this, however, will have the effect of blocking the scanner
			so use it sparingly.
