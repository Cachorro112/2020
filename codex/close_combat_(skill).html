<h1>Close Combat (skill)</h1>
<div class='dmCodexBody'>
<p><div class='codexLore'>This skill describes your training in hand-to-hand combat or melee weapon usage. While expertise in this area is rare in the era of firearms, experts still exist among athletes.</div></p>
<h3>OOC Information</h3>
<p><div class='codexMechanics'><h4>Unskilled</h4>You can throw a punch or a kick, but it'll knock you off-balance. You're inexperienced and have probably never been in a serious hand-to-hand fight. In a fight, you might panic and run, grab whatever's nearby and blindly strike out with it, or (if the other guy is just as much of a beginner as you are) make a fool out of yourself.<br>- You can disarm, grab, and hit. Their success chance depends on the fighters' skill difference.<br>- The chance of falling over when tackled is reduced with level.<br><h4>Basic</h4>You either have some experience with fistfights, or you have some training in a martial art. You can handle yourself if you really have to, and if you're a security officer, can handle a stun baton at least well enough to get the handcuffs onto a criminal.<br><h4>Trained</h4>You have had close-combat training, and can easily defeat unskilled opponents. Close combat may not be your specialty, and you don't engage in it more than needed, but you know how to handle yourself in a fight.<br>- You can parry with weapons. This increases with level.<br>- You can do grab maneuvers (pinning, dislocating).<br>- You can grab targets when leaping at them and not fall over, if your species is able to do so.<br><h4>Experienced</h4>You're good at hand-to-hand combat. You've trained explicitly in a martial art or as a close combatant as part of a military or police unit. You can use weaponry competently and you can think strategically and quickly in a melee. You're in good shape and you spend time training.<br><h4>Master</h4>You specialize in hand-to-hand combat. You're well-trained in a practical martial art, and in good shape. You spend a lot of time practicing. You can take on just about anyone, use just about any weapon, and usually come out on top. You may be a professional athlete or special forces member.</div></p>
