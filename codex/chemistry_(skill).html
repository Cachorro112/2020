<h1>Chemistry (skill)</h1>
<div class='dmCodexBody'>
<p><div class='codexLore'>Experience with mixing chemicals, and an understanding of what the effect will be. This doesn't cover an understanding of the effect of chemicals on the human body, as such the medical skill is also required for medical chemists.</div></p>
<h3>OOC Information</h3>
<p><div class='codexMechanics'><h4>Unskilled</h4>You know that chemists work with chemicals; you know that they can make medicine or poison or useful chemicals. You probably know what an element is and have a vague idea of what a chemical reaction is from some chemistry class in your high school days.<br><h4>Basic</h4>You can make basic chemicals or medication--things like space cleaner or anti-toxin. You have some training in safety and you won't blow up the lab... probably.<br>- You can safely use the industrial grinder but lose some ingredients. Its amount decreases with skill level.<br><h4>Trained</h4>You can accurately measure out reagents, grind powders, and perform chemical reactions. You may still lose some product on occasion, but are unlikely to endanger yourself or those around you.<br>- You can fully operate the chem dispenser.<br><h4>Experienced</h4>You work as a chemist, or else you are a doctor with training in chemistry. If you are a research chemist, you can create most useful chemicals; if you are a pharmacist, you can make most medications. At this stage, you're working mostly by-the-book. You can weaponize your chemicals by making grenades, smoke bombs, and similar devices.<br>- You can examine held containers for scannable reagents.<br><h4>Master</h4>You specialized in chemistry or pharmaceuticals; you are either a medical researcher or professional chemist. You can create custom mixes and make even the trickiest of medications easily. You understand how your pharmaceuticals interact with the bodies of your patients. You are probably the originator of at least one new chemical innovation.<br>- You can examine held containers for all reagents.</div></p>
