		<h1><a name="Prep">Prepping the expedition</a></h1>
		Every digsite I've been to, someone has forgotten something and I've never yet been to a dig that hasn't had me hiking to get to it - so gather your gear
		and get it to the site the first time. You learn quick that time is money, when you've got a shipful of bandits searching for you the next valley over,
		but don't be afraid to clear some space if there are any inconvenient boulders in the way.

		<h1><a name="Tools">Knowing your tools</a></h1>
		Every archaeologist has a plethora of tools at their disposal, but here's the important ones:
		<ul>
			<li><b>Picks, pickaxes, and brushes</b> - don't underestimate the the smallest or largest in your arsenal, each one clears a different amount
				of the rockface so each one has a use.</li>
			<li><b>Measuring tape</b> - don't leave home without it, you can use it to measure the depth a rock face has been excavated to.</li>
			<li><b>GPS locator</b> - knowing where you are is the first step to not be lost.</li>
			<li><b>Core sampler</b> - use this to take core samples from rock faces, which you can then run to the lab for analysis.</li>
			<li><b>Depth scanner</b> - uses X-ray diffraction to locate anomalous densities in rock, indicating archaeological deposits or mineral veins.
				Comes with a handy reference log containing coordinates and time of each scan.</li>
			<li><b>Alden-Saraspova counter</b> - uses a patented application of Fourier Transform analysis to determine the difference between background and
				exotic radiation. Use it to determine how far you are from anomalous energy sources.</li>
			<li><b>Radio beacon locator</b> - leave a beacon at an item of interest, then track it down later with this handy gadget. Watch for interference from other
				devices though.</li>
			<li><b>Flashlight or portable light source</b> - Self explanatory, I hope.</li>
			<li><b>Environmental safety gear</b> - This one's dependent on the environment you're working in, but enclosed footwear and a pack of internals
				could save your life.</li>
			<li><b>Anomaly safety gear</b> - A biosealed and catalysis-resistant suit along with eye shielding, tinted hood, and non-reactive disposable gloves are
			the best kind of protection you can hope for from the errors our forebears may have unleashed.</li>
			<li><b>Personal defence weapon</b> - Never know what you'll find on the dig: pirates, natives, ancient guardians, carnivorous wildlife...
				it pays in blood to be prepared.</li>
		</ul>

		<h1><a name="Find">Finding the dig</a></h1>
		Wouldn't be an archaeologist without their dig, but everyone has to start somewhere. Here's a basic procedure I go through when cataloguing a new planet:
		<ul>
			<li><b>Get in touch with the locals</b> (in particular geologists, miners, and farmers) - Never know what's been turned up by accident, then left to
				gather dust on a shelf.</li>
			<li><b>Check the obvious areas first</b> - even if you're pressed for time, these ones are the generally easiest to search, and the most likely targets
				of your rivals.</li>
			<li><b>Do some prospecting</b> - the earth mother isn't in the habit of displaying her secrets to the world (although sometimes you get lucky).
				Drop a shaft and clear away a bit of surface rock here and there, you never know what might be lurking below the surface.</li>
			<li><b>Tips on unearthing a deposit</b> - How do you know when you're golden? Look for telltale white strata that looks strange or out of place, or if
				something has broken under your pick while you're digging. Your depth scanner is your best friend, but even it can't distinguish between
				ordinary minerals and ancient leavings, if in doubt then err on the side of caution.</li>
		</ul>

		<h1><a name="Analyse">Analysing the contents of a dig</a></h1>
		You've found some unusual strata, but it's not all peaches from here. No archaeologist ever managed to pull a bone from the earth without doing thorough
		chemical analysis on every two meters of rock face nearby.
		<ul>
			<li><b>Take core samples</b> - Grab a rock core for every 4m^2.</li>
			<li><b>Clear around any potential finds</b> - Clear away ordinary rock, leaving your prizes reachable in a clearly marked area.</li>
			<li><b>Haul off excess rock</b> - It's easy for a dig to get cluttered, and a neat archaeologist is a successful archaeologist.</li>
			<li><b>Don't be afraid to be cautious</b> - It's slower sometimes, but the extra time will be worth the payoff when you find an Exolitic relic.</li>
			<li><b>Chemical analysis</b> - I won't go into detail here, but the labwork is essential to any successful extraction. Marshal your core samples, and
				send them off to the labcoated geniuses.</li>
		</ul>
		<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>
		<h1><a name="Excavate">Extracting your first find</a></h1>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Scan the rock</b> - Use a depth scanner to determine the find's depth and clearance. DON'T FORGET THESE.</li>
			<li><b>Choose stasis field</b> - Chemical analysis on a core sample from the rock face will tell you which field is necessary to extract the find safely.</li>
			<li><b>Setup field gen</b> - Bolt it down, choose the field, check the charge, and activate it. If you forget it, you'll wish you hadn't when that priceless
				Uryom vase crumbles as it sees the light of day.</li>
			<li><b>FUNCTIONAL AND SAFE digging</b> - Dig into the rock until you've cleared away a depth equal to (the anomaly depth MINUS the clearance range). The find
				should come loose on it's own, but it will be in the midst of a chunk of rock. Use a welder or miniature excavation tool to clear away the excess.</li>
			<li><b>FANCY AND SPEEDY digging</b> - Dig into the rock until you've cleared away a depth equal to the anomaly depth, but without any of your strokes
				entering the clearance range.</li>
			<li><b>The big find</b> - Sometimes, you'll chance upon something big, both literally and figuratively. Giant statues and functioning remnants of Precursor
				technology are just as exciting, to the right buyers. If your digging leaves a large boulder behind, dig into it normally and see if anything's hidden
					inside.</li>
