<h1>Atmospherics (skill)</h1>
<div class='dmCodexBody'>
<p><div class='codexLore'>Describes your knowledge of piping, air distribution and gas dynamics.</div></p>
<h3>OOC Information</h3>
<p><div class='codexMechanics'><h4>Unskilled</h4>You know that the air monitors flash orange when the air is bad and red when it's deadly. You know that a flashing fire door means danger on the other side. You know that some gases are poisonous, that pressure has to be kept in a safe range, and that most creatures need oxygen to live. You can use a fire extinguisher or deploy an inflatable barrier.<br>- RPD may give out random pipes, chance decreases with levels. <br>- You cannot recompress pipes with the RPD.<br><h4>Basic</h4>You know how to read an air monitor, how to use an air pump, how to analyze the atmosphere in a space, and how to help seal a breach. You can lay piping and work with gas tanks and canisters. If you work with the engine, you can set up the cooling system. You can use a fire extinguisher easily and place inflatable barriers so that they allow convenient access and airtight breach containment.<br>- You can recompress pipes with the RPD.<br><h4>Trained</h4>You can run the atmospherics system. You know how to monitor the air quality across the installation detect problems, and fix them. You're trained in dealing with fires, breaches, and gas leaks, and may have exosuit or fire gear training.<br>- You can use the RPD safely.<br><h4>Experienced</h4>Your atmospherics experience lets you find, diagnose, and fix breaches efficiently. You can manage complex atmospherics systems without fear of making mistakes, and are proficient with all monitoring and pumping equipment at your disposal.<br>- You can dispense a larger selection of pipes from the RPD.<br><h4>Master</h4>You are an atmospherics specialist. You monitor, modify, and optimize the installation atmospherics system, and you can quickly and easily deal with emergencies. You can modify atmospherics systems to do pretty much whatever you want them to. You can easily handle a fire or breach, and are proficient at securing an area and rescuing civilians, but you're equally likely to have simply prevented it from happening in the first place.</div></p>
