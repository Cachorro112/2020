<h1>Electrical Engineering (skill)</h1>
<div class='dmCodexBody'>
<p><div class='codexLore'>This skill describes your knowledge of electronics and the underlying physics. A low level of this skill implies you know how to lay out wiring and configure powernets, a high level of this skill is required for working complex electronic devices such as circuits or bots.</div></p>
<h3>OOC Information</h3>
<p><div class='codexMechanics'><h4>Unskilled</h4>You know that electrical wires are dangerous and getting shocked is bad; you can see and report electrical malfunctions such as broken wires or malfunctioning APCs. You can change a light bulb, and you know how to replace a battery or charge up the equipment you normally use.<br>- Every time you open the hacking panel, wires are randomized.<br>- Every time you pulse a wire, there is a chance you pulse a different one.<br>- Every time you cut a wire, there is a chance you cut/mend extra ones.<br>- You can misconnect remote signalling devices.<br><h4>Basic</h4>You can do basic wiring; you can lay cable for solars or the engine. You can repair broken wiring and build simple electrical equipment like light fixtures or APCs. You know the basics of circuits and understand how to protect yourself from electrical shock. You can probably hack a vending machine.<br>- Every time you open the hacking panel, some wires might be duplicated.<br><h4>Trained</h4>You can repair and build electrical equipment and do so on a regular basis. You can troubleshoot an electrical system and monitor the installation power grid. You can probably hack an airlock.<br>- You can safely hack machines.<br><h4>Experienced</h4>You can repair, build, and diagnose any electrical devices with ease. You know your way around APCs, SMES units, and monitoring software, and take apart or hack most objects.<br>- You can safely place remote signaling devices.<br>- You can examine one or two wires on the hacking panel.<br><h4>Master</h4>You are an electrical engineer or the equivalent. You can design, upgrade, and modify electrical equipment and you are good at maximizing the efficiency of your power network. You can hack anything on the installation you can deal with power outages and electrical problems easily and efficiently.<br>- You can examine most wires on the hacking panel.</div></p>
