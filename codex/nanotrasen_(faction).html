<h1>NanoTrasen (faction)</h1>
<div class='dmCodexBody'>
<p><div class='codexLore'>The NanoTrasen Corporation, commonly referred to as NT, is one of the great megacorporations of the modern day.Currently headquartered in Tokyo on Japan and headed by CEO Asahi Trasen It deals in research of the most advanced sciences, such as genetics, warp drive, and - recently - the uses of phoron and the contain and study of anomaly, as well as mass consumer manufacturing on a truly gigantic scale. They also have a sizeable asset protection and security branch with which they secure both investments and occasionally new acquisitions - a distressing rival to some minor and major companys such as Space X, and a powerful administrative branch sitting atop it all, directing their company's actions. NanoTrasen is characterized by its aggression and questionable ethics, which, combined with the high emphasis they put on new, untested and dangerous technology, means their installations are often considered unsafe and hazardous.</div></p>
