		<h1>Detective Work</h1>
		Between your bouts of self-narration and drinking whiskey on the rocks, you might get a case or two to solve.
		To have the best chance to solve your case, follow these directions:
		<p>
		<ol>
			<li>Go to the crime scene. </li>
			<li>Take your scanner and scan EVERYTHING (Yes, the doors, the tables, even the dog). </li>
			<li>Once you are reasonably certain you have every scrap of evidence you can use, find all possible entry points and scan them, too. </li>
			<li>Return to your office. </li>
			<li>Using your forensic scanning computer, scan your scanner to upload all of your evidence into the database.</li>
			<li>Browse through the resulting dossiers, looking for the one that either has the most complete set of prints, or the most suspicious items handled. </li>
			<li>If you have 80% or more of the print (The print is displayed), go to step 10, otherwise continue to step 8.</li>
			<li>Look for clues from the suit fibres you found on your perpetrator, and go about looking for more evidence with this new information, scanning as you go. </li>
			<li>Try to get a fingerprint card of your perpetrator, as if used in the computer, the prints will be completed on their dossier.</li>
			<li>Assuming you have enough of a print to see it, grab the biggest complete piece of the print and search the security records for it. </li>
			<li>Since you now have both your dossier and the name of the person, print both out as evidence and get security to nab your baddie.</li>
			<li>Give yourself a pat on the back and a bottle of the ship's finest vodka, you did it!</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
		It really is that easy! Good luck!
