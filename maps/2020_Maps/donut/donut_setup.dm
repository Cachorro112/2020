	return "NSS Helios, Populatedly called the 'Donut Station'; It is a space station orbiting the planet Cassini IV, making an orbit next to an asteroid where a research facility and mining base is located. Helios was one of the first space stations built by Nanotrasen during an era called the 'Golden Age', which was the best time (theoretically) of Nanotrasen. \
	the purpose of the station (like several others) is advanced research, mainly of the Phoron material and other minor research such as medical and engineering. with the passage of time its brilliance was taken over by larger and more modern stations, leaving Helio defaced for a while... until Nanotrasen redesigned and modernized the station."
